TechYa - A project managment application for students and young people 

As a team we created a project management web application targeted at students and young people. Our application, titled ‘TechYa’, is built around a messaging page through which a team can communicate about a project. Teams can create specific ‘Tasks’ within a project, which are stored in a mongodb database along with the messages.

Our objective was to create an application which makes it easier to break down and delegate tasks within a project group. We decided to do this as we were initially doing all of our planning for the project on facebook messenger and we found that that gave us many challenges when it came to working productively. 

We felt that a creating a simple service dedicated solely to team work would be a helpful tool to reduce the distractions associated with using a social network for college assignments. 
We wanted the application to be intuitive and easy to use, with a minimal design but as many useful functionalities as possible.
